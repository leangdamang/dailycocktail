Learning to Code - Testing Out APIs, JSON pulls, and SMTPLIB via a Daily Cocktail Email

This is a pretty simple program that pulls in a random cocktail, as provided by CocktailDB, 
reads it to a file, pulls out pertinent information from the json, and sends it out in an email to a list. 

Improvements include figuring out how to personalize the message while using MIME Multipart messages.
